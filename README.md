# City Guide App

## Getting Started

This project is developed for a school project. For this project we just implemented the main use case which is locating the user and showing nearby attractions. I'll try to add new features soon. With this app any tourist or local is able to access the data of nearby touristic attractions. With the slider on top you can change the search area from 750m to 5000m. It's easy to use and no need for registeration. For now the app uses 2 main API: Places API which is a product of Google Maps and Wikipedia API. Places API is used for retrieving data to display markers on the map and place details. Wikipedia API is used for retrieve a brief information about place. It basically search the place name on the Wikipedia and mostly true information for popular places. Once you download the project you just need to get your own Places API key and insert it on the project. Just search for "insert your api key here" in the project and change those strings. You are ready to go!

Here is a few screenshot of the app:
